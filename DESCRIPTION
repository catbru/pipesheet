Description: Pipesheet is an R package that provides functions for viewing and editing Excel files. It relies on the xlsx and dplyr packages for reading and writing Excel files, and allows users to view and edit Excel files using either LibreOffice (for Unix-based systems) or Microsoft Excel (for Windows systems). The package provides functions to write data frames to Excel files, open them in Excel for viewing, and read edited data back into R as tibbles.
