\title{View Excel Data in R}
\usage{
view(data, row.names = FALSE)
}
\description{
The \code{view} function allows users to view data from R in Microsoft Excel. It takes a data object as input and writes it to a temporary Excel file (.xlsx) using the \code{xlsx} package. The Excel file is then opened in Excel for viewing.

On Unix-based systems, the function uses the \code{system} function to set the \code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment variable to locate the LibreOffice executable for opening the Excel file. On Windows-based systems, the function uses the \code{shell} function to open the Excel file using the default Excel application.

This function is useful for quickly visualizing data in Excel without the need to save and open a separate Excel file manually.

\examples{

data <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 2, 3),
  Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35)
)

view(data)

\title{Edit Excel Data in R}
\usage{
edit(data)
}
\description{
The \code{edit} function allows users to edit data from R in Microsoft Excel. It takes a data object as input and writes it to a temporary Excel file (.xlsx) using the \code{xlsx} package. The Excel file is then opened in Excel for editing.

On Unix-based systems, the function uses the \code{system} function to set the \code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH} environment variable to locate the LibreOffice executable for opening the Excel file. On Windows-based systems, the function uses the \code{shell} function to open the Excel file using the default Excel application.

After editing the data in Excel, the changes are saved to the temporary Excel file, and the edited data is read back into R using the \code{xlsx} package and converted to a tibble using the \code{dplyr} package.

This function is useful for quickly editing data in Excel and updating it in R without the need to manually save and reload Excel files.

data <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 2, 3),
  Name = c("John", "Alice", "Bob"),
  Age = c(25, 30, 35)

edited_data <- edit(data)
